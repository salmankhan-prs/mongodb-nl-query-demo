# I Built ChatGPT for MongoDB (And Open-Sourced It)

> **Read Time: 8-10 minutes**

*"Show me all React developers who interviewed last month with evaluation scores above 85."*

In most companies, this simple question becomes a 2-hour engineering ticket. A recruiter asks. Engineering writes a custom MongoDB aggregation. Back-and-forth on requirements. Deploy. Repeat for the next question.

At my recruitment SaaS, this was happening 10+ times per day. Our product velocity was dying.

What if recruiters could just **ask the database directly**, like ChatGPT?

After 5 days of intense coding, I cracked it. Not just a demoâ€”a production system handling complex recruitment data for real customers. Today, I'm open-sourcing the solution.

## The Real Problem

I'm building a SaaS product in the recruitment industry. Think **"Notion AI, but for recruitment databases."** Our customers are recruiters managing thousands of job applications, interviews, and candidate profiles.

The problem hit us hard: Recruiters constantly needed insights from their data. 

- "Show me all candidates with React experience from last month's applications"  
- "Which interviews had the highest evaluation scores?"
- "Find applicants who are good cultural fits for this specific role"

Each insight required our engineering team to write custom MongoDB queries. The bottleneck was killing our product velocity.

**Real numbers:**
- 10+ custom query requests per day from users
- Engineering bottleneck: Each insight = custom code  
- Business impact: Slower feature development, frustrated customers

I decided to build something that would let recruiters talk directly to their recruitment database.

## The Technical Challenge

Building this wasn't just "connect LLM to MongoDB." I had to solve four core problems:

### Problem 1: Schema Drift
MongoDB schemas evolve constantly. New fields, enum values, relationships appear. Hardcoded mappings break in production.

**My solution**: Dynamic schema introspection that reads Mongoose models in real-time and generates up-to-date prompts.

### Problem 2: Complex Query Planning  
Real queries need 3-5 step reasoning. Cross-collection joins, aggregations, error recovery when queries fail.

**My solution**: LangGraph ReAct agents with multi-step planning that can reason through complex database operations.

### Problem 3: LLM Hallucinations
LLMs make up field names, assume enum values that don't exist, create invalid MongoDB syntax.

**My solution**: Schema-first prompting where the agent always checks the actual schema before building queries.

### Problem 4: Conversation Context
Users ask follow-up questions like "Now show me their interview scores." Need to maintain context across sessions.

**My solution**: Redis-backed conversation memory that maintains context across the entire conversation.

## The Architecture

Here's how the magic actually works:

```
Natural Language Query
        â†“
ðŸ§  LangGraph ReAct Agent (reasoning engine)
        â†“
ðŸ“‹ Dynamic Schema Inspector (reads Mongoose models)  
        â†“
ðŸ”§ MongoDB Tools (find/aggregate/count)
        â†“
ðŸ’¾ Redis Memory (conversation context)
        â†“
ðŸ“„ Smart Response (insights + explanations)
```

### The Schema-First Innovation

Every query starts here:
```typescript
// Dynamically introspects Mongoose models
const schema = extractCompleteMongooseSchema(ApplicantModel);
// Result: "skills: Array<String>, resumeAnalysis.compatibilityScore: Number(required) {min:0,max:100}"
```

### ReAct Agent Reasoning

Walk through a real example:
```
User: "Show me our top candidates"
Agent: OBSERVE â†’ Need to find highest-scoring candidates
Agent: THINK â†’ Should check applicants schema first  
Agent: ACT â†’ collectionSchema("applicants")
Agent: REFLECT â†’ Found compatibilityScore field (0-100)
Agent: ACT â†’ find({}, {sort: {compatibilityScore: -1}, limit: 10})
Agent: RESPOND â†’ "Here are your top 10 candidates..."
```

### Cost Optimization Breakthrough

Initially, I was sending all 20 collection schemas in every prompt - **massive token costs**.

The fix: **Two-step tool architecture**
1. First tool call: List available collections
2. Second tool call: Get specific collection schema only when needed

**Result**: 40% reduction in token costs.

### Cross-Collection Intelligence

Real production example:
```javascript
// Query: "Show me React developers who aced their interviews"
// Agent reasoning:
// 1. applicants.skills contains "React" 
// 2. interviews.applicantId links to applicants._id
// 3. postanalyses.recommendationPercentage > 80
// 4. Builds 3-way aggregation pipeline automatically
```

## Production Lessons

### Claude > GPT for Database Queries
- **Claude 3.5**: Better at complex reasoning chains, fewer hallucinations
- **GPT-4**: Makes up field names more often
- **Production switch**: Saved 40% error rate

### Redis Sessions Are Critical
- Users ask 3-4 follow-up questions on average
- "Now show me their interview scores"
- Without memory: Every query starts from scratch  
- With memory: Natural conversation flow

### Error Recovery Patterns
- Aggregation fails â†’ Fallback to simple find()
- Invalid field â†’ Re-check schema and retry
- Timeout â†’ Split complex query into smaller parts

## The Open Source Release

This solution shouldn't be limited to recruitment. Every company with MongoDB could benefit from natural language database access.

**What's in the repo:**
- Complete working system with demo e-commerce data
- Production-grade architecture with Redis sessions  
- Dynamic schema generation (works with any MongoDB)
- Sophisticated ReAct agent prompts
- TypeScript throughout for reliability

**Built for real use:**
- Rate limiting and error recovery
- Conversation memory management
- Token optimization for cost control
- Ready to deploy and customize

**Adaptation guide:**
1. Replace demo models with your Mongoose schemas
2. Run schema generator to build prompts  
3. Start querying your data in plain English

## The Future Vision

I want to make this **modular and plug-and-play**. Anyone should be able to connect their MongoDB database and get natural language querying instantly.

**Technical roadmap:**
- Write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- MongoDB session storage (replace Redis for permanence)
- Multi-database support  
- Web UI for non-technical users

**The bigger picture**: When anyone can ask questions directly to company databases, decision-making accelerates. Insights become accessible. Engineering teams focus on building, not writing custom queries.

## Try It Yourself

This represents 5 days of intense R&D distilled into a working system. I'm excited to see what the community builds with it.

**GitHub**: [mongodb-nl-query-demo](https://github.com/yourusername/mongodb-nl-query-demo)

**Quick start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mongodb-nl-query-demo
cd mongodb-nl-query-demo  
pnpm install
pnpm seed
pnpm start:dev
```

The future of human-database interaction is conversational. Let's build it together.
