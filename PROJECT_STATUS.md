# Project Status

## âœ… Completed Features

### Core Architecture
- [x] **Agent State Management**: Extracted from ai-interview-be with LangGraph workflow
- [x] **MongoDB Tools**: Complete toolset with find, aggregate, count, and schema tools
- [x] **Memory Management**: Redis-based conversation history with in-memory fallback
- [x] **ReAct Prompting**: Sophisticated prompts for natural language understanding
- [x] **Express API**: Clean REST API with error handling and rate limiting

### Database Layer
- [x] **Three Sample Collections**: Users, Products, Orders with realistic relationships
- [x] **Mongoose Models**: Complete schema definitions with indexes
- [x] **Data Seeding**: Script to populate sample data for testing
- [x] **Schema Tools**: Dynamic schema introspection for the agent

### Agent Intelligence
- [x] **Natural Language Processing**: Converts queries to MongoDB operations
- [x] **Cross-Collection Analysis**: Handles complex aggregation pipelines
- [x] **Contextual Responses**: Maintains conversation state across requests
- [x] **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages

### Developer Experience
- [x] **TypeScript Setup**: Full type safety with modern tooling (tsup, biome)
- [x] **Environment Configuration**: Flexible config with validation
- [x] **Comprehensive Documentation**: Startup-friendly README with examples
- [x] **Testing Scripts**: System validation and data seeding utilities

## ðŸš€ Ready to Use

The system is **production-ready** and can be deployed immediately. All core functionality has been extracted and adapted from the proven ai-interview-be implementation.

### What Works Now:
1. **Natural Language Queries**: "Show me all users from USA", "Find Apple products under $1000"
2. **Session Management**: Persistent conversations with Redis
3. **Complex Analytics**: Cross-collection analysis with aggregation pipelines
4. **Intelligent Responses**: Context-aware, formatted responses with explanations

### Required Setup:
1. **MongoDB**: Local or remote MongoDB instance
2. **AI API Key**: Anthropic Claude (recommended) or OpenAI
3. **Optional Redis**: For persistent sessions (falls back to memory)

## ðŸŽ¯ Perfect For

- **Open Source Example**: Demonstrates enterprise-level AI + database integration
- **Startup Foundation**: Ready-to-use natural language data interface
- **Educational Resource**: Shows how to build sophisticated LangChain agents
- **Production Deployment**: Can handle real workloads with proper infrastructure

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps for Users

### Quick Start (5 minutes):
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd mongodb-nl-query-demo
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add your MongoDB URI and AI API key to .env
pnpm seed
pnpm start:dev
```

### Testing:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/query \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"query": "Show me all users from USA"}'
```

### Customization:
1. Replace sample models with your MongoDB schema
2. Update tools in `src/services/mongoDBTools.ts`
3. Adapt prompts in `src/services/prompts.ts`
4. Deploy with your infrastructure

## ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

- **ReAct Agent Pattern**: Reasoning + Acting for reliable query execution
- **Tool-based Architecture**: Modular MongoDB operations with dynamic selection
- **Session Persistence**: Redis-backed conversation memory
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper error handling
- **Modern Stack**: Latest LangChain/LangGraph with production-ready setup

## ðŸ’¡ Innovation

This project bridges the gap between complex databases and natural language, making data accessible to non-technical users. It demonstrates how to build production-ready AI agents that can:

1. **Understand Intent**: Parse natural language into database operations
2. **Execute Intelligently**: Choose optimal query strategies automatically
3. **Respond Naturally**: Provide conversational, insightful responses
4. **Maintain Context**: Remember conversation history for follow-up queries

The architecture is **battle-tested** (derived from ai-interview-be) and **immediately useful** for any team wanting to democratize data access.
